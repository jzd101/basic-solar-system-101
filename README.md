# Solar System Simulation

This project is a simple 3D Solar System simulation built with React and Three.js (via @react-three/fiber). It allows you to explore the planets, control the orbit speed, and adjust the scene brightness.

## Features and Changes

- **Interactive 3D Solar System**: View the Sun and planets orbiting around it.
- **Orbit Controls**: Pan, zoom, and rotate the camera to view the system from different angles.
- **Focus Mode**: Click on any planet to focus the camera on it.
- **Orbit Speed Adjustment**: Use the "Orbit Speed" slider to speed up, slow down, or pause the orbital simulation.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Use the new "Brightness" slider to adjust the ambient light level, allowing for better visibility of planet textures and details.
